    This demo uses more TensorFlow function to implement neural network

    Reference:
        https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/neural_network.py

    Somethings learned:
        [1]. Are 'weight and bias' implementation the same as MatLab implementation ?
        [2]. In GitHub example, cost function is a cross entropy. Any difference from the one in MatLab?
        [3]. What is tensor layers ?
